The find_conditional_b_0___.R scripts find the value of the conditional beta_0 on the log-odds scale which
corresponds to the value of the marginal control event risk.
The find_marg___.R scripts find values of the marginal treatment effects given values of 
the conditional effects.
The simulations___.R and plots___.R correspond to the simulation and plotting functions, respectively.
